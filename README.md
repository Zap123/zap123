I'm a solutions-oriented senior backend engineer based in Switzerland, I began my working career in 2015 and then went back to do a MSc in Computer Science as I became fascinated by cyberphysical systems but my passion with informatics goes well beyond that. My first wonder began at 6 years old with the SNES console and Nintendo's Super Mario All Stars game, at 14 I discovered Game Maker and was dreaming of developing my own games, then a couple years later I started learning to program in Python to host my own Ultima Online's private server. At 16 I discovered the Linux operating system as a CD attachment in a videogame magazine showcasing Knoppix and it blew my mind so much that I became obsessed with it, for the first time I saw my personal computer as a programmable machine and not just a platform to run programs. Later I discovered Slackware by buying every magazine that talked about GNU/Linux and this is why I'm a Linux user since then and dearly thankful to the Free software movement. 

In my professional life I have been working mostly with international startups in different fields with focus on the blockchain and healthcare. I've never had a fixed job title and I've taken every single opportunity to work on as many different roles as I could both by striving to be a great developer and also by adventuring more in the business side of things by clearly understanding the domain of each industry I've worked for. Some of my favorite IT books are Seven Languages in Seven Weeks, Clean Architecture, The Pragmatic Programmer and Domain-Driven Design.

My main programming languages are C# .Net Core, Typescript (Nodejs) and Python, but here you'll see many short projects that I use as a testbench to try new technologies and languages or to scratch a personal itch. 

When I'm not programming you'll find me on the internet, having fun with my friends or traveling the world. 
Please feel free to [contact me](https://lucacosta.dev), I enjoy talking with everyone and sharing knowledge.
